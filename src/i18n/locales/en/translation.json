        "content": "Crush Lab Poker is a tool that helps poker players base themselves on a GTO range with pre-flop actions, such as raises, 3-bets, folds, among others. With our dynamic charts tool you will no longer have doubts about what to do in certain situations. The available chart focuses on cash game players and considers an average stack of 50+ big blinds. Coming soon, new versions with opponent profile filters (tight, fish, reg), medium stack filters, as well as the possibility of creating your own ranges and saving them so that the ranges are more compatible with your game and opponents."
